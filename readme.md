Two teams, the assassins and the guardians, battle respectively to kill or defend the king.
At the start of a game two players get randomly picked to be the king or first assassin.
The assassins win the game by killing the king while the guardians and king win by surviving.
The assassins strive to kill the king, they can get more allies by killing guardians as they turn into assassins when killed.
